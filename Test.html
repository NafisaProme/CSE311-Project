            <h2 style="position: relative; left: 200px;">MRI</h2>
            <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a 
            type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to 
            produce detailed images of the inside of the body.An MRI scanner is a large tube that
             contains powerful magnets.<br> You lie inside the tube during the scan.
            An MRI scan can be used to examine almost any part of the body, including the:
            brain and spinal cord,bones and joints,breasts,heart and blood vessels
            internal organs, such as the liver, womb or prostate gland </p>

        <h2 style="position: relative; left: 200px;">X-RAY</h2>
        <p>X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. 
        The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white.
        This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, 
        so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black.
        The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. </p>

    <p>Blood tests have a
     wide range of uses and are one of the most common types of medical test.
     Most blood tests only take a few minutes to complete and are carried out at your GP surgery or local hospital 
     by a doctor, nurse or phlebotomist (a specialist in taking blood samples).

        <h2 style="position: relative; left: 200px;">ENDOSCOPY</h2>
        <p>An upper endoscopy is a procedure used to visually examine your upper digestive system with a tiny camera on the end of a long,
         flexible tube. A specialist in diseases of the digestive system (gastroenterologist) uses an endoscopy to diagnose and, sometimes,
         treat conditions that affect the esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum).</p>

        <p>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. 
        Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. </p>

        <h2 style="position: relative; left: 100px;">COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>Computed tomography (CT) scan is a useful diagnostic tool for detecting diseases and injuries. It uses a series of X-rays and a computer to produce a 3D image of soft tissues and bones. CT is a painless,
         noninvasive way for your healthcare provider to diagnose conditions. </p>
